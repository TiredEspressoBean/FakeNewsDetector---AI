# Fake News Detection using BERT

## Overview

This project implements a Fake News Detection system using the BERT model to classify news articles as real or fake.

## Technical Details

- **Model:** BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **Data Preprocessing:** Standard preprocessing techniques
- **Training:** Fine-tuning BERT on labeled dataset
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run setup: `python setup.py install`

## Usage

```python
from fake_news_detector import FakeNewsDetector

detector = FakeNewsDetector()
result = detector.detect_fake_news("Sample news article text.")
print(result)
Results
Achieved accuracy of X%. See results/ for detailed metrics.
